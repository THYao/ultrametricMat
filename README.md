# ultrametricMat
The ultrametricMat is a package designed to conduct the Bayesian inference on the ultrametric matrices by the leveraging the bijection map between the ultrametric matrices and the tree space. We refer to more details to  Yao et al. (2023+) Geometry-driven Bayesian Inference for Ultrametric Covariance Matrices.
